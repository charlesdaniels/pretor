* Initial release.

0.0.2:

* Switched compression method to ZIP_DEFLATED for better compatibility

* pretor-psf how stores the Pretor version and PSF format revision number in
  each PSF file. PSFs with missing format revisions are assumed to be revision
  0, which is the current. PSFs with newer format revisions will not be
  unpacked.

0.0.3:

* --no_meta_check, --allow_no_tom, and --disable_version_check now write keys
  into both metadata and forensic data.

  which causes pretor-psf --create to validate that the specified assignment
  name is one of those specified in this list.
